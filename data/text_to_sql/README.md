## 4. Introduction
The SQL table `table1` holds data related to industrial activities, including variables such as year (`anni`), different types of industrial metrics (`cig ordinaria totale cigo`, `cig straordinaria`, etc.), and a percentage variation (`variazione percent`). Understanding the structure of this table and potential queries provides insights into its contents and the types of analysis that can be conducted.

## 5. Table Schema Overview
The table `table1` has the following schema:

- **anni** (integer, nullable): Represents the year of the data entry.
- **cig ordinaria totale cigo** (bigint, nullable): Represents the total ordinary CIGO value.
- **cig straordinaria** (bigint, nullable): Represents extraordinary CIG values.
- **cig ordinaria industria** (bigint, nullable): Represents ordinary CIG values specific to the industry sector.
- **cig ordinaria edilizia** (bigint, nullable): Represents ordinary CIG values specific to the construction sector.
- **complesso** (bigint, nullable): A complex metric related to the dataset.
- **variazione percent** (double precision, nullable): Percentage variation in some metric across entries.

## 6. Possible Queries and Their Interpretations
The following are some possible queries on `table1` along with their SQL representations:

### Query 1: Count All Rows
- **SQL**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Retrieves the total number of rows in `table1`.

### Query 2: Select Rows for a Specific Year
- **SQL**: `SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE anni = 2020;`
- **Interpretation**: Fetches all data entries for the year 2020.

### Query 3: Sum of Total Ordinary CIGO
- **SQL**: `SELECT SUM(cig_ordinaria_totale_cigo) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Calculates the total sum of the `cig_ordinaria_totale_cigo` column across all entries.

### Query 4: Average Percentage Variation
- **SQL**: `SELECT AVG(variazione_percent) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Determines the average of the `variazione_percent` values.

### Query 5: Count Rows Where Extraordinary CIG is Greater Than 1000
- **SQL**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 WHERE cig_straordinaria > 1000;`
- **Interpretation**: Counts how many entries have `cig_straordinaria` values greater than 1000.

### Query 6: Maximum Value in Industry Ordinary CIG
- **SQL**: `SELECT MAX(cig_ordinaria_industria) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Identifies the maximum value in the `cig_ordinaria_industria` column.

### Query 7: Sum of Construction and Extraordinary CIG
- **SQL**: `SELECT SUM(cig_ordinaria_edilizia + cig_straordinaria) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Computes the combined sum of the `cig_ordinaria_edilizia` and `cig_straordinaria` columns.

### Query 8: Minimum Year in Data
- **SQL**: `SELECT MIN(anni) FROM table1;`
- **Interpretation**: Finds the earliest year recorded in the table.

## 7. Data Analysis and Interpretation
Based on the schema and the queries executed on `table1`, several insights can be derived:

- The **total count of entries** gives an overview of the dataset's size.
- **Summing and averaging** specific columns provide insights into trends in industrial metrics.
- **Filtering data by specific criteria** like year or thresholds in metrics allows for more targeted analysis.
- **Maximum and minimum values** in specific columns help identify outliers or extreme cases in the dataset.

## 8. Conclusion
The structure of `table1` enables various types of analyses that can provide insights into industrial trends over different years. The columns store a range of data types, from integer counts to double precision percentages, making it versatile for both summary and detailed analyses. Understanding and constructing SQL queries tailored to this schema can help extract valuable information from the dataset.
